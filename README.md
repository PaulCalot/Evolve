Evolution of a population of a given specy called Blop.

Unity version : 2019.4.10f1 (LTS)

## Description

In this personal project, one can see individuals (that I named "Blops"), that are evolving in a given environment composed of red mushrooms, the food Blops eat.

A Blop as a given energy that depletes as it lives and moves, when it gets below zero, the Blop dies. The Blop gets energy from the mushrooms.

In addition to that, the blop has a certain chance of becoming seek, when it does, it becomes green. Once it becomes seek, it can infect other Blops, heal (it then becomes red) or dies (it then becomes black).
